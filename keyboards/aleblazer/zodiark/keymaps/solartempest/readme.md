### Tap and Other Features:
-   Push left-shift + backspace to delete whole words. Right-shift + backspace to delete whole words in the opposite direction.
-   Double tap layers to stay on a layer instead of momentary push.

### Acknowledgements
-   Thanks Drashna for the OLED timeout and extensible rotary encoder code.
-	Thanks Dasky for helping me resolve prior trackball code issues.
-	Thanks to Hellsingcoder for creating Luna and Jackasaur for optimizing the code for less space. This was the base code I used for my pixel art.

## Using with VIA (Important! Please Read.)

-   After flashing, in VIA make sure to Import Keymap, which is "zodiark VIA keymap.json". This will alow VIA to recognize the updated layout and custom functions. VIA will auto-recognize the default keyboard but that does not match this firmware because of the necessary customization.
-   Go to Save+Load to Load Saved Layout. You can import my own layout "zodiark VIA layout.json" or just use the Keymap tab to assign your own keys. Having another keyboard connected can be handy for doing this step.
-   It is a good idea to Save Current Layout after you decide on your mapping.


# Compiling

Compile with the command below:

```sh
# for Elite C with Left Side Master builds
qmk compile -kb aleblazer/zodiark -km solartempest
```

## Flashing

Flash using the correct command below or use QMK Toolbox. Specifying side during compile is unnecessary as Master Left is defined by default:

```sh
# for pro micro-based builds
qmk flash -kb aleblazer/zodiark  -km solartempest

# for Elite C or dfu bootloader builds
qmk flash -kb aleblazer/zodiark  -km solartempest
```

These commands can be mixed if, for example, you have an Elite C on the left and a pro micro on the right.
Press reset button on he keyboard when asked.

Disconnect the first half, connect the second one and repeat the process.
